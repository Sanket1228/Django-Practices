{% block body %}Your About Us page is one of the most important pages on your website. It’s also likely to be one of the most frequently visited.  So you’d better make it good.  Keep the following suggestions in mind:

Much of today’s business is transacted over the web or over the phone without an in-person meeting. For that reason, your About Us page must do more than communicate what’s special about your company’s products or services; it also must inspire trust because without trust, you’ll never get the prospect to reach for his wallet.

One of the easiest ways to begin building trust? Tell them where’ you’re located. To visitors, you’re probably just a website address. That’s pretty impersonal.

Even if you have your mailing address on your Contact page, it’s still a good idea to mention at least your city and state on your About Us page. Then visitors have a sense of how close, or far, you are to them. That’s information they can relate to. So simple and yet so many businesses neglect to do so. Every nugget of information you openly share helps inspire a little more trust.{% endblock %}
